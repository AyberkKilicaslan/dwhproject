        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
            <br>
            <h5> Goal/Contribution</h5>
            <p>The major goal of this study is to use the ability of young talents to predict a player’s
                position. Regardless of the player’s current position, machine learning models performed
                with the assistance of statistics from analytical teams produce a position where the player
                can be more efficient. As a result, the player’s potential will be better reflected, and he
                will be able to accomplish higher results in his future development. These studies have
                resulted in significant contributions to both the athlete and the team.</p>
            <h5>Project Scope
            </h5>
            <p>The aim of this study is to develop a model that estimates the correct positions of
                athletes using statistical data prepared so far. As a team, it was decided that the easiest
                way to do this was to use the game data of Fifa 2022, the largest football game in the
                world. These data are generated by monitoring football analysts of football players
                showing their abilities in almost all leagues of the world and testing football players with
                special devices in special environments. This large data set that has been created so far is
                at the level that it can prioritize inference for newly grown football players.
                The data set consists of many numeric and non-numeric values. These values consist
                of the physical characteristics of football players and their ability to score. At the end of
                the study, along with the model that will be obtained, forecasting will take place by
                providing the most important capabilities to the model by the user. The properties with
                linear relationships to each other are shown in the Confusion matrix heat map graph.
                When looking at the graph, defensive abilities are closely related to other defensive
                abilities, and offensive abilities are mostly related to other offensive abilities.</p>
